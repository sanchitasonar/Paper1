During my final year of Bachelor’s in Engineering, I co-authored and published a research paper with IFERP (Institute for Engineering Research and Publication) on Frequent Itemset Mining. The paper focused on analyzing large transactional datasets to identify frequent item combinations using association rule mining techniques. We implemented algorithms such as Apriori to discover meaningful patterns and evaluate support and confidence metrics. The research emphasized optimizing performance for large datasets and demonstrated practical applications in market basket analysis and data-driven decision-making. This work strengthened my understanding of data mining concepts, pattern recognition, and analytical problem-solving.
